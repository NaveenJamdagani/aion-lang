In a language, expressions include:
    10
    x
    5 + 3
    3 * (4 + 1)
    x + y * z

The parser must understand:
    precedence (* happens before +)
    grouping (parentheses)
    identifiers
    number literals
    prefix operators (!x, -x)
    infix operators (x + y, x * y)
    return expressions (later)
    function calls (later)

To do this, we use a well-known technique:

⭐ Pratt Parsing (industry standard)
    Used by:
        Rust compiler
        TypeScript
        JavaScript engines
        Many modern languages
    But I will simplify it for you.

Expression Parsing Basics (Intermediate)
    1. Expressions are the "math and logic" parts of a program.
    2. They must follow rules of precedence: * before +.
    3. Parser must build correct AST structure for expressions.
    4. Pratt Parsing is a technique that simplifies expression parsing.
    5. We will implement:
    - prefix expressions: -x, !x
    - infix expressions: x + y, x * y
    - grouping: (x + y)
    6. This is the hardest part of building a programming language.
    7. Once expressions work, the language becomes powerful.

⭐ OUR GOAL FOR THIS PART
    Add support for these:
        let x = 5 + 3;
        let y = x * 2;
        let z = 10 - 4 + 1;
    Meaning our parser must produce AST like:
        LetStatement "x"
        value: InfixExpression(
                    left: NumberLiteral(5)
                    operator: +
                    right: NumberLiteral(3)
                )

Expression Parsing Summary
    1. We are implementing Pratt Parsing.
    2. Pratt parsing uses:
    - Prefix parse functions (for !x, -x)
    - Infix parse functions (for x + y)
    3. Parser determines precedence to build correct AST shape.
    4. After this part, AION can understand mathematical and logical expressions.
    5. This is the hardest part of compiler front-end development.

⭐ Example AST Display (What We Will Build)
    For this code:
        let x = 5 + 3 * 2;
    AION will output:
        {
            "type": "LetStatement",
            "name": "x",
            "value": {
                "type": "Infix",
                "operator": "+",
                "left": { "type": "NumberLiteral", "value": 5 },
                "right": {
                    "type": "Infix",
                    "operator": "*",
                    "left": { "type": "NumberLiteral", "value": 3 },
                    "right": { "type": "NumberLiteral", "value": 2 }
                }
            }
        }

    AION AST will use JSON-like display format.
    Benefits:
    - easy to read
    - industry standard
    - supports debugging and future tools
    - clear hierarchy for expressions
