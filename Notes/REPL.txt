⭐ Build the REPL (Interactive AION Shell)
    Here is why REPL is the best next move:

    ✔ It makes your language feel REAL immediately
        You will type:
            aion> let x = 10;
            aion> x + 5;
            15

    ✔ It showcases beautifully in your GitHub portfolio
        Recruiters LOVE interactive demos.
    ✔ It’s SIMPLE to build (only ~20 lines of code)
        No complex parser changes needed.
    ✔ It makes debugging future features easier
        When we add functions, closures, arrays, strings, and AI-native features — REPL helps test instantly.
    ✔ It’s the first milestone where your language becomes alive
        This is the moment your project goes from “compiler code” to an actual tool.

AION REPL:
- Reads input line by line
- Parses into AST
- Evaluates using interpreter
- Reuses the same environment across commands
- Enables interactive testing for all future language features

⭐ Build
    cargo build
⭐ STEP 4 — Run your REPL
    ./target/debug/aion   || cargo run
